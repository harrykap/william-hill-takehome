This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Install and Run

The app was built with node version 12.14.1 and npm version 6.13.4. Later versions should also work but have not been tested

Unpack the zip file

####From the command line 
(I used gitbash):

Change into the directory containing the file 'package.json'
Run:  npm install
Then run: npm start

The app should be available at http://localhost:3000
